                <h3>Tesla's rapid rise</h3>
                <p class="mainparagraph">The Roadster marked the beginning of the entry into the automotive industry
                    for the
                    company founded in 2003, which was renamed from Tesla Motors to Tesla, Inc. in 2017. From the
                    very
                    beginning, Tesla positioned itself as a manufacturer of pure electric vehicles and quickly
                    established
                    itself as a pioneer of electric mobility. The brand became enormously successful with the Model
                    S, above
                    all thanks to its batteries with a long range, autonomous driving
                    and a design language that is sleek, modern and attractive. Today, Tesla is almost like the
                    Apple of the
                    car industry.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="sectionarticle">
                <h3>A new entry-level model</h3>
                <p class="mainparagraph">With the Model 3 presented in 2016, Tesla finally expanded its range of vehicles
                    with a
                    comparatively
                    small and therefore also affordable model, which is comparatively small and therefore also
                    affordable, to appeal to a broader target group. At a price of just over €40,000, the
                    Model 3 now makes it possible to enter the world of electric mobility with the "T" on
                    the bonnet. However, Tesla would not be Tesla if the Model 3 would not still be in the upper
                    middle
                    class.</p>

                    <h3>What's new for 2021?</h3>
                    <p class="mainparagraph">Tesla is giving its entry level Model 3 sedan a host of enhancements for 2021,
                        including
                        exterior
                        styling elements that have swapped bright chrome for satin black trim. Three new wheel
                        designs
                        give
                        the rolling stock a fresh look, and the trunk lid is now power-operated. Appearance
                        upgrades
                        continue inside where the car's metallic door-sill protectors inherit the black satin
                        trim to
                        match
                        the exterior. The Model 3's center console has been redesigned to accommodate two
                        wireless
                        smartphone charging pads, and the sun visors now use a magnet to hold them in place. The
                        seat-adjustment controls and the steering-wheel-mounted infotainment scroll wheels have
                        new
                        finishes—the former in graphite colored paint and the latter in metal. Most important of
                        all is
                        the
                        Model 3's improved driving range. The base Standard Range Plus model now claims a
                        driving range
                        of
                        263 miles per charge, up from 250, while the Long Range model boasts a 353-mile range,
                        31 miles
                        more
                        than the 2020 model delivered.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h3>
                    <p class="mainparagraph">As with most EVs, the Model 3 gains speed smoothly and almost silently, with
                        the
                        electric
                        motor
                        providing strong power from a stop. And it's fast—extremely so in some trims. The
                        rear-wheel-drive
                        Long Range model we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. The Model 3
                        Performance
                        rockets to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds—0.5-second faster than our long-term Model Long Range.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h3>
                    <p class="mainparagraph">We're not exaggerating when we say that the Tesla Model 3 has an interior
                        unlike any
                        other
                        car on
                        the market today. It's shockingly simple inside, with nearly everything controlled by the
                        monolithic
                        touchscreen in the center of the dashboard. The Tesla's low, flat floor makes for a spacious
                        and
                        airy feel inside. The front seats are supportive and comfortable, but the rear seats are
                        cramped and
                        uncomfortable; don't expect adults to be able to spend time in them. Folding the 60/40
                        split-folding
                        rear seats is simple and expands the trunk considerably. The Model 3's seatbacks fold flat,
                        too,
                        providing an uninterrupted cargo floor for hauling larger items. With the rear seats folded,
                        the
                        Model 3 provides enough room for 15 carry-on suitcases. There are also generously sized bins
                        and
                        cubbies throughout the cabin.</p>

                <h4>Model S: Business saloon with a model function</h4>
                <p>The Model S is considered the benchmark for electric business sedans, and to keep it that way, the
                    model
                    is constantly being adapted. In addition, there are regular software updates that optimise range and
                    operation. There are now three different versions of the Model S: Maximum Range, Plaid and Plaid+.
                    The
                    former is equipped with all-wheel drive including a dual engine. The other two have a three-motor
                    all-wheel drive.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="lastparagraph"><a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_eu/modelx"><img

                <h4>Model X: The electric SUV</h4>
                <p>The Tesla SUV offers space for seven passengers. It is available in the Maximum Range
                    and Plaid variants.
                    Both models have a duomotor all-wheel drive. And just like the other models, the Model X is also
                    ahead
                    of the game when it comes to safety: 360-degree all-round cameras, ultrasonic sensors, side impact
                    protection, an extra-large crumple zone and front boot reduce the risk of injury in accidents. A
                    HEPA
                    filter integrated into the ventilation system reliably removes pollen, germs, viruses and pollutants
                    from the outside air in the car interior.</p>
